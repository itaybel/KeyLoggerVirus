# KeyLoggerVirus

A cool keylogger virus which will sent all the keys you press to a remote server.
(That was a bonus question in one of my HW in Magshimim)
## How to use

in your own computer, run:
`python server.py`

I recommend opening the project in visual studio, and producing an exe file which will be the virus.
